# Memory Game
 Milestone Project 1

## Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck history and citation:

The Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck is a classic tarot deck first published in 1909 by US Games Systems, Inc. It was created by Arthur Edward Waite, a British occultist and author, and Pamela Colman Smith, an American artist and illustrator. The deck features 78 cards, each with its own unique symbolism and meaning, and is widely used for divination, meditation, and spiritual guidance.

In this project, I use the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck to create a memory game that challenges players to match pairs of cards and improve their memory skills. The cards are randomly shuffled and displayed face down on the screen. The player must flip them over, one by one, to find the matching pairs in the alloted time. If they succeed, they win, with the option to play again. If they fail, they lose, again with the option to try again.

I acknowledge the creators and publishers of the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck for their contribution to the world of tarot and divination, and I use their work with respect, appreciation, and reverence.

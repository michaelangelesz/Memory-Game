## Milestone Project 1
# Memory Game

As a kid, Memory was a favorite game. This game is dedicated to those carefree days of old school board games. As an adult, I have come to love the game of Tarot. Here I get to combine the two in a new, modern atmosphere! 

In this project, I use the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck to create a memory game that challenges players to match pairs of cards and improve their memory skills. When the user arrives to my game, they are given a certain amount of lives. When they begin flipping the cards, each mismatch takes a life. When the lives count reaches zero, the game ends and a game-over screen appears, in this case with the text "Egads! 😵‍💫 Foiled again!". However, if the user is able to reveal all the matches with the lives provided, a win screen appears with the message "🤩 Awesome! You win! 🤩". In either case, the user is presented with a button to start a new game.

The Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck is a classic tarot deck first published in 1909 by US Games Systems, Inc. It was created by Arthur Edward Waite, a British occultist and author, and Pamela Colman Smith, an American artist and illustrator. The deck features 78 cards, each with its own unique symbolism and meaning, and is widely used for divination, meditation, and spiritual guidance.

I acknowledge the creators and publishers of the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck for their contribution to the world of tarot and divination, and I use their work with respect, appreciation, and reverence.
